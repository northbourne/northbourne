# Northbourne

Northbourne is a context-agnostic configuration management agent written in Rust. It takes the best features of Puppet, Chef and Ansible and combines them into one single unusable program.

## Context Agnostic?

Northbourne is designed to run independant from the host you want to configure. The context can be the local shell, a remote one, or even a custom one if SSH isn't supported.
